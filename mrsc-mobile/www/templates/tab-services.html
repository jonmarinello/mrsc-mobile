          Have an app idea or design you want to get into this rapidly growing marketplace?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's build the next great mobile app for the iOS or Android platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          We love building mobile apps. We specialize in iPhone, iPad & Android app development.
        </p>
        <p>
          We started developing Mobile apps two years ago in response to the growing demand in the mobile app
          development space. Mobile application development is now a critical part of any product strategy and its worth
          thinking through if you need a native mobile app or you prefer a responsive web approach where the mobile
          experience on your site is optimized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mobile app development is moving fast, and we're committed to staying on top of the best frameworks,
          techniques and design standards for mobile.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're ready to get started developing your mobile app when you are.

          Rails development is our passion and we love building applications with this framework because of the speed

        <p>
          If you have a great idea for a website but want to save on development costs, Content Management Systems (CMS)
          may be the best solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          CMS provides a less flexible framework for building websites but at a much lower cost. You choose
          from a predetermined set of layout templates
        </p>
        <p>
          When would CMS be the best solution for your website?
        </p>
        * Low cost is critical
        <br>
        * Time-to-market is a factor
        <br>
        * Minimal control over behavior and layout is acceptable
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Together we'll thoroughly brainstorm your website ideas and see if the CMS approach will work best for you or whether a traditional
          website is what you need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is one example of a CMS-based website we built for

        <p>
          Time-to-market, more flexible support for business strategies by IT, and faster response time to
          competitive conditions are combining to accelerate cloud computing adoption today.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are looking for expertise in cloud computing then we can help. Cloud computing has become an integral
          part of businesses of all sizes because it allows a company to focus on what they do best without the hassle
          of hardware and software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cloud computing is in high demand because it allows companies to scale with ease. They can pay for as much as
          they use whether it be processing, storage or other cloud services. The cloud brings a high level of
          automation to tasks that in the past was not possible which can save companies time and money.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many different cloud computing solutions and it can be daunting to figure out what exactly your
          company needs. Our cloud computing experts know this and can help you form a plan for your cloud
          implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together we'll explore the power, flexibility and cost savings that cloud computing offers and how it can
          benefit your organization.

          Don't waste time coding until you understand your UX requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before writing any code
          we'll build a set of wireframes to mockup your web or mobile application. Mockups are easy to build quickly and
          super easy to refine. This avoids wasting time writing code for user interfaces that haven't been thoroughly
          thought through and will then need to be changed multiple times.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Doing this iteration in wireframe mockups significantly reduces costs.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Together we'll iterate your ideas by getting immediate and meaningful feedback. Sketch-style wireframes help focus
          the conversation on content and interaction, not minute details (those can come later).
        </p>
        <p>
          Since mockups require little investment in time and effort, we'll help you revise your UX designs more often
          and refine them sooner, leaving more time for discussion and writing code.

          We are a dedicated Scrum development shop with Scrum certification.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to develop your project in close concert with you. Along the way, delivering and iterating usable
          features that you can use now. Using Scrum we can get you the most "bang for the buck" as early as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agile development provides opportunities to assess the direction throughout the development lifecycle.
          This is achieved through regular cadences of work, known as Sprints or iterations, at the end of which teams
          must present a potentially shippable product increment. By focusing on the repetition of abbreviated work
          cycles as well as the functional product they yield, agile methodology is described as “iterative” and
          “incremental.” In waterfall, development teams only have one chance to get each aspect of a project right.
          In an agile paradigm, every aspect of development — requirements, design, etc. — is continually revisited.
          When a team stops and re-evaluates the direction of a project every two weeks, there’s time to steer it in
          another direction.
